# Tech Port

Tech Port is a ticket management system that provides the ability to serve multiple universities and keep track of their maintenance needs.
### Purpose
This technology gives  the admin team the oversight to control each campus and to track their progress through maintenance issues.

It also gives each technician a portal in which they can see the campus tickets that have been opened by the admin team. They can track their progress through the tickets they are assigned, as well as provide feeback throughout the process.
